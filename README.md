#### assembly
- prepare two wire loops, look at

  discrepancy:  
  the guides grooves are designed for 1 mm (enameled) copper wire  
  using thicker wire might make the construction wobbly

- assemble three sandwiches  
  mind the grooves of the guides  
  one sandwich may hold the mounts  
  strap each sandwich with zip ties
  
  order  
  tie + (mount) + guide_low + wire-loop 1 + guide_high + carry + guide-high + wire-loop 2 + guide_low + (mount) + tie

- the antenna was tuned by positioning CMOS foam between the wire loops  
  surprisingly this worked very well and accurate
