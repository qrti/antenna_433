  discrepancy: this printed parts are designed for 1 mm (enameled) copper wire
               using thicker wire might make the construction wobbly

- assemble three sandwiches, strap them with zip ties
  mind the grooves of the guides
  one sandwich may hold the mounts

  tie + (mount) + guide_low + wire-loop 1 + guide_high + carry + guide-high + wire-loop 2 + guide_low + (mount) + tie

- I tuned the antenna by positioning CMOS foam between the wire loops, surprisingly this worked very well and accurate
